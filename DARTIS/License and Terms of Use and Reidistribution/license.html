           <div><strong>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to protect (our "content") and the members of our community, we need these end user license terms to set out some rules for downloading and using our content. This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Progressive Dynamics Global Ltd Co) and describes the terms and conditions for using the content. We don't like reading license documents any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using our content. If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our lawyers to help out.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you buy, download, use or access our content/services, you are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user license agreement ("EULA") terms. If you don't want to or can't agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or access our content. This EULA incorporates the terms of use for the pdglobal.net website ("Account Terms"), our brand and asset usage guidelines, our privacy policy, and, our Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this EULA you also agree to all of the terms of the foregoing documents, so please read through them carefully.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>AGREEMENT TO THIS CONTRACT/EULA</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You agree to this CONTRACT/EULA by<br/><br/><strong>(A)</strong>Clicking "I agree" in our content, services, applications, website, or software.<br/><br/><strong>OR</strong><br/><br/><strong>(B)</strong>By using or accessing our content, services, applications, website, or software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Under the agreement, we both agree to use a neutral arbitrator to decide any individual claims that may arise and thus agree to waive our rights to bring individual claims in court for consideration by a judge or jury. We also agree that class action lawsuits and class-wide arbitrations are not allowed under the terms of this agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>ONE MAJOR RULE</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By "distribute anything we've made" what we mean is:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>give copies of our content to anyone else;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>make commercial use of anything we've made;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>try to make money from anything we've made; or</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>let other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><em><strong>unless</strong></em> we specifically agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear, "the content" or "what we have made" includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for our content. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified versions of the content, part of those things, or anything else we've made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don't do those things that we say you can't.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>USING OUR CONTENT</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have been granted a license to the content so you can access and use it, yourself, on your devices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Below we also give you limited rights to do other things. If you wish to make something pertaining to anything we've made we're humbled, but please make sure that it can't be interpreted as being official and that it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage guidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we've made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The license and permission we give you to use and access our content can be revoked if you break any of the terms of this EULA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you access our content, you receive a license that gives you permission to install the content on your own personal computer and use and access it on that computer as set out in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not allowed to distribute the content (or any part of it) to anyone else. This also means you cannot sell or rent the content, or make it available for access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any license keys. You may however give gift codes that have been bought through our official gift code system. This is important to help us stop piracy and fraud and to protect our content. It is also important to prevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of our content or fraudulent license keys - which we may cancel, such as in the case of fraud.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hacked versions or Modded Versions of the content client or server software are not okay to distribute</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything we've made unless we've specifically said it's okay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to ensure the integrity of the content, we need all content downloads and updates to come from a single central source: us. It's also important for us that 3rd party tools/services don't seem "official" as we can't guarantee their quality. It's part of the responsibility we have to the customers of Minecraft. Make sure that you read through our brand and asset usage guidelines too.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>OWNERSHIP OF OUR CONTENT AND OTHER THINGS</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although we license you permission to install on your computer and access our content, we are still the owners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained in the content. Therefore, when you pay for (or use) our content, you are receiving a license to access / use our content in accordance with this EULA. The only permissions you have in connection with the content and your installation of it are the permissions set out in this EULA.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>CONTENT/SERVICES</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you make any content available on or through our content or services, you agree to give us permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly disaccess that content. This permission is irrevocable, and you also agree to let us permit other people to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly disaccess your content. You are not giving up your ownership rights in your content, you are just giving us and other users permission to use it. For example, we may need to copy, reformat, and distribute content that you post on our website so others can read it. If you don't want to give us these permissions, do not make content available on or through our services. Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it may be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don't like.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are going to make something available on or through our content, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation. Some examples of the types of things you must not make available using our content include: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that are offensive or that damage our or another person's reputation; posts that include porn or someone else's creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Any content you make available on our content must also be your creation or you must have permission or the legal right to do it. You must not and you agree that you will not make any content available, using the content that infringes the rights of others.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you get a copy of our content, we provide it "'as is"'. Updates are also provided "'as is"'. This means that we are not making any promises to you about the standard or quality of our content, or that our content will be uninterrupted or error free. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that it may cause. You bear the entire risk as to its quality and performance. You have to accept that we may release contents well before they are complete and so they may (and often will) have bugs -but we prefer to release these features early than make you wait for perfection. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you and we ever have a dispute in court (and we hope that won't happen just as much as you do), the exclusive forum (that is, the place it will be handled) will be a corporate, state or federal court in Fairfield County, OH.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>TERMINATION</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach any of the terms. You can terminate it too, at any time; all you have to do is<br/><br/><strong>(A)</strong>uninstall/remove all content provided by the services from your computer.<br/><br/><strong>AND</strong><br/><Br/><strong>(B)</strong>cease access to/use of ALL of our content and then the EULA will be terminated.<br/><br/> If the EULA is terminated, you will no longer have any of the rights to the content given in this license. You do still have the right to things you have created yourself with the content of course. The Arbitration Agreement and the paragraphs about "Ownership of Our content", "Our Liability", "Research &amp; Development" and "General Stuff" will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.</div>
